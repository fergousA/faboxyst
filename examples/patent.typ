It is hereby declared that the present invention consists in carrying an
elliptical nib along the path of the intended stroke, the major axis of the
nib being kept at an angle of about twenty-four degrees to the tangent, so
that the mark left by the pen is thin when the nib runs with the line and
full when it is crossed.

#fabox(title: [Premier mode d'exécution], colour: antique-palette.patent-ink)[
  The frame is drawn twice: a heavy outer rule and a thinner inner rule, the
  two being the envelopes of the same nib at two weights. A small diamond is
  placed at each outer corner.

  the dash length, the offset, a jitter and a seed are all parameters.],

The same device, applied to a full page, yields the plates and patents in
which the present boxes are commonly displayed: aged paper
(#raw("#F5EDDF")), patent ink (#raw("#221E1A")), Garamond body at ten
points, justified, with a leading of #raw("0.62em"). No colour is used
beyond the ink and the paper; the pale ink (#raw("#786A58")) may be employed
for rules and captions that are meant to fade.
